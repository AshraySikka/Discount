# Discount

This Python script calculates the **final amount after applying a discount** based on the original bill value entered by the user. It uses conditional (`if-elif-else`) logic to apply different discount rates depending on the amount.

## 💰 Discount Rules

| Bill Amount Range      | Discount Applied |
|------------------------|------------------|
| ₹0 – ₹1,000            | 10%              |
| ₹1,001 – ₹5,000        | 20%              |
| ₹5,001 – ₹10,000       | 30%              |
| ₹10,001 and above      | 50%              |
